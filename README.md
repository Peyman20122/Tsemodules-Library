## StockManager Class

The StockManager class allows you to easily manage, download, process, and extract information about various stocks. This class can be easily used in different projects and more functionality can be added to it by adding new features and methods.

### Example:

    from tsemodel7 import StockManager, IndexManager

    stock_manager = StockManager()
    index_manager = IndexManager()

    # Example calls
    print(stock_manager.stocklist())
    print(stock_manager.stock("آپ", value=10, standard=True))
    print(index_manager.index(value=10))

 ## HighPriceManager Class
This class uses an online source to download stock data and then processes and analyzes the data to find the stock's highest closing price.

Using newfile and standard parameters allows you to have more control over the process of downloading and processing data.
The get_highest_close_price_today method examines only the data from the previous day and displays them in sorted order.
### Example:

    high_price_manager = HighPriceManager()

    # Example calls
    highest_close_prices_df = high_price_manager.get_highest_close_price_today(standard=True)
    print(highest_close_prices_df)
